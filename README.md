# 🌟 My Django Personal Portfolio

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to the codebase for my **Personal Portfolio Website**, built with 🐍 **Django**, a pinch of Bootstrap, and a sprinkle of custom CSS magic.  
This site is my digital playground — a place where I showcase my projects, skills, and the occasional dash of creativity.
